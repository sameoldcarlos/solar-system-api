## What is the Solar System API?

It is a simple, but very complete tool where you can query and see information
about all the eight planets in the Solar System.

## What kind of information you will find here?

Everything!

Nah! Just kidding... There is a list of attributes below, as well as the measurement units used in the API.

### Register

>>> Pay attention to the information below in order to make the application work properly

Users need register if they want to use the API. An api key is generated and sent to the registered e-mail. 

If you want your users to receive the e-mail containing the API key, you must change the email settings on the project. Just go to the '.env' file and you will have access to these settings.
